This standard is not intended to duplicate existing standards or standards being developed by other groups on these topics, and will reference these where appropriate. This standard will elaborate on the charging requirements described in the Charging Principles in UMTS 22.01 Service Principles. It will allow the generation of accurate charging information to be used in the commercial and contractual relationships between the parties concerned. 2 Normative references The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in this text, constitute provisions of the present document. - References are either specific (identified by date of publication, edition number, version number, etc.) or non-specific. - For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply. - For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. - A non-specific reference to an ETS shall also be taken to refer to later versions published as an EN with the same number.

Charging: A function whereby information related to a chargeable event is formatted and transferred in order to make it possible to determine usage for which the charged party may be billed. Real time: Time, typically in number of seconds, to perform the on-line mechanism used for fraud control and cost control. Settlement: Payment of amounts resulting from the accounting process. Short time: Time, typically in number of minutes, to perform the off-line mechanism used for accounting. 3.2 Abbreviations For the purposes of the present document, the following abbreviations apply: CDR Call Detail Record 4 Requirements The main new requirements for UMTS charging and accounting are: - to provide a call detail record for all charges incurred and requiring settlement between the different commercial roles; - to allow fraud control by the Home Environment and the Serving network; - to allow cost control by the charged party; - to provide at the beginning of a chargeable event an indication to the charged party (if involved in the chargeable event) of the charges to be levied for this event; - to allow itemised billing for all services charged to each subscription, including voice and data calls, and services offered by home environments. These new requirements will allow users more freedom to obtain service when roaming, whilst providing effective cost and credit control for the Home Environment and User. 4.1 Cross Phase Compatibility for Release 99 There are no earlier releases of the UMTS standards for which backward compatibility of equipment implementing these standards is required. It is envisaged that UMTS will evolve beyond Release 99, for example with the addition of a number of new requirements for charging and billing; these are noted in the appropriate sections below.

Some of the information is provided by the user, other information is only available in the network element of the serving network. Depending on the type of chargeable event some of the information may not be available or might not be required. 5.1.1 Information provided by the user The user’s user equipment that is incurring the charge shall provide the following information to the serving network: - User identity used for authentication; - Home environment identity; - Terminal Identity and Terminal Class; - Destination endpoint identifier for service requested (e.g. B number); - Resource requested (e.g. bandwidth, connectionless); - QoS parameters (e.g. maximum delay). 5.1.2 Information provided by the serving network The serving network serving the user shall provide the following information to the home environment: - All of the information listed in section above (Information provided by the user); - Serving network identity; - Recording network element identity; - Universal Time (UT) at which the service request was initiated; - Universal Time (UT) at which resources were provided for the service; - Resource allocated to the user; - Quantity of data transferred both to and from the user; - QoS provided to the user; - Location of the user in the standard format used for UMTS location based services (e.g. geographical co- ordinates, Cell ID); - whether GSM Optimal Routing was applied; - If IN or CAMEL services were applied, the service parameters and the actually used destination number and calling party number identification; - Time duration covered by this call record to an accuracy of at least 1 second; - Unique identity of the chargeable event which allows the billing system to correlate all records belonging to the same chargeable event; - Unique CDR identity (unique per network element", "meta": {"ingested_at": 1759756682, "relative_path": "22115-320.pdf"}}

As alternative it should be possible to apply reverse charging or to charge the event to a party not involved in the event itself (e.g. a company as VPN subscriber). It should be possible for multiple leg calls (e.g. forwarded, conference or roamed) to be charged to each party as if each leg was separately initiated. However, in certain types of call, the originating party may wish/be obliged to pay for other legs (e.g. SMS MO may also pay for the MT leg.). It shall be possible to change the chargeable party at the call set-up. In case of inter-network chargeable events, the CDR usually does not contain the charged party, but it can be derived from network configuration information contained in the CDR. For each party to be charged for a chargeable event or parts of it a separate CDR shall be generated. 5.2 Special Cases 5.2.1 Long calls The advent of packet data services, which can extend for very long periods of time (days, weeks etc), although at low cost because charges are based on data throughput, may mean that billing records are only output at the end of very long periods. For this reason the serving network shall support the generation of call records also during the life of the packet data session, either when some charge value is reached or some duration or both, to allow for both charging settlement and cost control. 5.2.2 Multimedia calls During one call the user may invoke different services like speech, data transmission, video and audio, which may lead to a separate CDR for each service. If several CDRs will be the result of each multimedia call, the billing system shall be able to correlate these records and to indicate to the user on the bill that they belonged to one call. 5.2.3 E-Commerce The UMTS system may be used to trade soft goods (e.g. information, video, audio), or hard goods (e.g. books) of high or low value per item between the user and a merchant. It shall be possible for such merchants to charge users directly for services they provide.

However, if the serving network acts as merchant of soft goods, it may charge the user directly, creating a CDR as described above or using micropayment mechanisms. 5.2.4 Volume Based Charging It shall be possible to charge for the total volume of data/packets sent and received by the user. 6 Transfer of Charging Information The efficient transfer of charging information between serving networks and from serving networks to home environments requires a standardised interface between these entities. It shall be possible to define different time intervals for the transfer of charging information between serving network and home environment (e.g. when a chargeable event occurs, when a chargeable event is initiated by the user, when a chargeable event terminates, at regular intervals during a chargeable event).

A mechanism to validate the source and integrity of the information shall be provided so that: - The home environment shall be able to validate the source and integrity of the charging information supplied by the serving network; - The serving network shall be able to validate the source and integrity of the charging information supplied by the user; - The serving network shall have proof that services were provided to a specified user. 7 Accounting and Settlement The serving network shall collect and process the charging data generated in its network elements. The record of each individual transaction shall be reported to the home environment at short time intervals in order to provide itemised bills, and to deal with any disputes regarding charges both for users and for other UMTS networks and home environment. The standard shall support the transfer of charging data at different intervals as required by the Home Environment (e.g. short time intervals, real time, other regular intervals). 7.1 Delegation of charging authority The registration process allows the home environment to authenticate users before they incur any charges. Once authenticated, the home environment then delegates authority to the serving network operator with which he has a direct commercial relationship to incur charges for services supplied to that user. The direct commercial relationship may be with either the serving network operator if known directly by the home environment or a network operator known to the home environment.

This mechanism shall be able to handle all possible charging scenarios, and all service and tariff variants that the home environment and the serving network may offer to the user. The user shall be able to set in his home environment a limit for the accumulated charges per time interval. Upon exceeding this limit or prior to incurring a charge which would exceed the limit, certain actions may be desired by the user: • notification to the user, requesting to extend the limit, or • Home Environment barring allowing no further originating calls, or • Home Environment barring cancelling the roaming permission. 7.3.1 Cross Phase Compatibility For Release 99 the cost control mechanism may be based on Advice of Charge. However the Release 99 standards should not prevent the future implementation of the full Cost Control requirements. The Release 99 standards should allow these new features to be introduced in a backward compatible manner; specifically terminals conforming to Release 99 standards should continue to support the Release 99 service requirements when operating with future implementations of Advice of Charge in the Home Environment. 7.4 Inter-network Settlement Mechanisms shall also be provided to allow inter-network settlement of charges on a bulk basis. The same mechanisms shall be used between home environments and serving networks. This will allow each of these parties to meter the total input and output of charges and thus determine the payments required on a periodic basis between each of the parties with which they directly interact. The mechanisms used shall allow each of the parties to meter charge flows independently, with the aim of matching the values recorded at both sides of the same interface. The imbalance in charge flow shall be accumulated in short time, such that each entity can be informed when a threshold has been exceeded and determine whether to continue. 8 Automatic Roaming Agreements Support for the requirements in this section is not", "meta": {"ingested_at": 1759756682, "relative_path": "22115-320.pdf"}}

However the Release 99 standards should not prevent the future implemenation of this requirement in a backward compatible manner (eg a roaming broker enabled Home Environment should inter-operate with a R99 Serving Network). It is a requirement that UMTS users shall be able to obtain service and use chargeable services with networks with whom neither they nor their home environment have any direct commercial agreement. This shall be enabled by interworking via trusted third parties. Each Home Environment shall interwork with one or more serving network operators, with whom they would negotiate a commercial roaming agreement and test the interworking. Any user wishing to use the services of a particular serving network would register with that serving network, who would either directly or indirectly interwork with the home environment.
